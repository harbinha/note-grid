Tone Matrix
=========

- This Java application was created by myself and another for a class project.
- The audio frequency was doubled until reaching the terahertz level (visible light) to obtain the button colors.
- This application uses MIDI technology for audio output.
- Java must be installed for the tone matrix to work properly.
